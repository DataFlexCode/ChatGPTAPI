ChatGPT API

Just a bit of fun.  I thought of doing one for Bard too but it says: "_As of today, there is no Google API for me. I am still under development, and Google is not yet ready to release an API for me to the public. However, I am sure that Google is working on it, and I am excited to see what the future holds for me_".  Considering it is just auto-correct on steroids, it is getting a bit above itself!

The two OAuth2 packages in the AppSrc are not actually required - I just thought they might be when I started out.

__Note__: although I (stupidly!) left my API key in the source when uploading to GitHub, OpenAI detected that and invalidated it, so you will have to get your own.  I might change it to get its key from somewhere outside the workspace.
